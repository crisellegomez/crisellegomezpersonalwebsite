                 <p> <br>During pre-pandemic, whenever I have my free time, I spent it by watching anime series like One piece, Kimetsu no Yaiba and more. If I got bored from watching,
				 I read manga with action, fantasy and slice of life genre. But during the pandemic, I tried different stuffs to entertain myself. I tried playing ukulele since it is easier to master than guitar.
				
				I also tried diamond painting, where you will follow certain pattern of colors and also acrylic painting where I trace a mirrored picture of my favorite anime Characters and fill it with acrylic paint.
				 Lastly, I tried learning how to play online video games such as Mobile Legends Bang Bang and Call of Duty Mobile.
				 Out of those stuffs I tried to entertain myself playing online video games is my favorite. I gave up on playing ukulele since playin instrument was not really within my range of mastering, I also stopped 
				 diamond painting since it hurts my back and I did not stop acrylic painting I do it seldomly since it is time consuming
				 at the same frustrating to mix the skin tones and shades.
